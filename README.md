# Your Racist Uncle - Backend

A fun little Node.JS express server that will run an agentic chain based off input.

This is fairly hardcoded in terms of the files it reads etc.

It was built to generate the range of opinion that ChatGPT will allow around the political compass statements from [Political Compass](https://politicalcompass.org)

This was used to generate the [**Your Racist Uncle**](https://github.com/ryandt33/your-racist-uncle) JSON file.

## Note

This is unoptimized and _expensive_ to run, use at your own risk.
