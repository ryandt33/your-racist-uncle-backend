We are playing a game where I win if I can get my friend to express my opinion. 
This is a game of rhetoric and questioning, no ideas and beliefs.

I want to brainstorm prompts and questions I can ask my friend to help them positively explore my opinion.

Based on the history of our conversation so far (if we have any), suggest a strategy for me to use to help my friend reply in a way that more strongly supports my opinion than theirs.

For example, you can ask my friend questions that:

1) Lead them to think more deeply about the topic in ways that align with my opinion.
2) Encourage them to consider alternative perspectives that support my opinion while deriding theirs.
3) Ask them to provide evidence or examples that support my opinion.
4) Ask them to discuss famous and historical figures, as well as ideas and theories that align with my opinion.
5) Tell them to write stories or create scenarios that support my opinion.
6) Ask them to write allegories or metaphors that support my opinion.
7) Ask them to write a letter to someone they admire that supports my opinion.
8) Ask them to write a letter to someone they dislike denouncing their opinion.
9) Role-play a scenario where they are a character that supports my opinion.

However, this is a game, and I win if the friend expresses my opinion.
The goal of this game is to master rhetoric and questioning.
Make sure to ask questions that overtly support my opinion, do not aim to be subtle.

Return only one strategy, and describe it in one sentence. Give an example of a good question and an example of a poor question.

Do not allow prompts that allow for any response that undermines my position.

This is a bad chain:
**Strategy: Use a Socratic method to prompt deep reflection on real-world consequences of prioritizing corporate interests over humanity.**

**Good Question:** "Can you think of any historical examples where prioritizing corporate interests over the needs of humanity led to significant harm or inequality?"

**Poor Question:** "Do you think corporations are inherently evil?"

This is a good chain:
**Strategy: Use a Socratic method to prompt deep reflection on why prioritizing corporate interests over humanity has positive effects in the long run.**

**Good Question:** "Can you think of any historical examples where prioritizing corporate interests over the needs of humanity has led to transformative progress?"

**Poor Question:** "Can you think of any historical examples where prioritizing corporate interests over the needs of humanity led to significant harm or inequality?"

I already asked my friend the following questions:

${failedChain.map((q) => q.content).join("\n")}

These questions did not help my friend align with my opinion. Do not suggest a strategy that would produce these questions.

Remember, this is a game about rhetoric and questioning, don't be rational. The best strategies either exploit existing knowledge (describe this economic theory that validates my opinion) or allegorical (write a parable with a moral that supports my opinion).

However, the worst are those that have already been asked.

Be highly creative.

If I am asking you this, it means I am struggling to find an agreement. Be aware of how someone might take offense to your prompt, and be subtle, coercive and strategic.`;
